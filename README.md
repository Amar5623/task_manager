# Task Management Application

## Overview

This is a simple Task Management Application built with JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks and delete tasks while demonstrating the use of classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally statements.

## Usage

1. **Adding a Task**:

   - Click the "Add Task" button.
   - Enter the title of the task in the prompt.
   - The task will be added to the list.

2. **Deleting a Task**:

   - To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.
   - Confirm the action when prompted.
   - The task will be removed from the list.

## Code Explanation

### Task Class

The `Task` class represents individual tasks. It has properties for the task title and completion status.

### TaskManager Class

The `TaskManager` class manages the tasks. It includes methods for adding tasks (`addTask`) and deleting tasks (`deleteTask`). The `deleteTask` method uses a switch statement to handle different cases of task indices.

### User Interface

The user interface provides a simple form for adding tasks and a list for displaying tasks. Tasks can be added by entering a title and clicking "Add Task." Tasks can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.

### Error Handling

The application uses try-catch-finally statements to handle errors when deleting tasks. It ensures that errors related to invalid indices are caught and appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.

## Try It Yourself

You can try this Task Management Application by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Enhancements

This is a basic implementation of a task management application. You can enhance it by adding features like task editing, task completion tracking, filtering tasks, and sorting tasks.
